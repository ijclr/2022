Submission deadline: 31 May 2022.

### Recently published papers Track 

IJCLR solicits submissions of high-quality papers on combining learning and reasoning that have been recently published, or accepted for publication, by a first-class conference such as ECML/PKDD, ICML, KDD, ICDM, AAAI, IJCAI, etc., or journal such as MLJ, DMKD, JMLR etc. Papers will be accepted on the grounds of relevance and quality of the original publication venue. Accepted papers will be presented at IJCLR. Submission deadline: 31 May 2022.
