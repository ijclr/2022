## IJCLR 2022  
  
The 2nd International Joint Conference on Learning & Reasoning (IJCLR) will be held in [Cumberland Lodge](https://www.cumberlandlodge.ac.uk/), Windsor Great Park, United Kingdom, 28-30 September 2022. 

The 1st International Joint Conference on Learning & Reasoning ([IJCLR 2021](http://lr2020.iit.demokritos.gr)) took place from 25-27 October 2021 (virtual). [[Video recordings]](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL18_rB75vx1PkjXnkX1jiqNeNnVCbNGIh). 

The rapid progress in machine learning has been the primary reason for a fresh look in the transormative potential of AI as a whole during the past decade. A crucial milestone for taking full advantage of this potential is the endowment of algorithms that learn from experience with the ability to consult existing knowledge and reason with what has already been learned. Integrating learning and reasoning constitutes one of the key open questions in AI, and holds the potential of addressing many of the shortcomings of contemporary AI approaches, including the black-box nature and the brittleness of deep learning, and the difficulty to adapt knowledge representation models in the light of new data. Integrating learning and reasoning calls for approaches that combine knowledge representation and machine reasoning techniques with learning algorithms from the fields of neural, statistical and relational learning.

Four international conferences and workshops addressing such research topics join forces in the 2nd International Conference on Learning & Reasoning (IJCLR 2022):

- The **[31st International Conference on Inductive Logic Programming (ILP)](https://ijclr22.doc.ic.ac.uk/ilp2022.html)**. The ILP conference series has been the premier forum for work on logic-based approaches to learning for three decades. Originally focusing on the induction of logic programs, over the years it has expanded its research horizon to other forms of relational learning and to probabilistic approaches.
- The **[16th International Workshop on Neural-Symbolic Learning & Reasoning (NeSy)](https://sites.google.com/view/nesy-2022/)**. The NeSy workshop series is the longest standing gathering for the presentation and discussion of cutting edge research in [neurosymbolic AI](http://www.neural-symbolic.org/). NeSy is the yearly meeting of the [Neural-Symbolic Learning and Reasoning Association](https://www.city-data-science-institute.com/nesy).
- The **11th International Workshop on Approaches and Applications of Inductive Programming (AAIP)**. The AAIP workshop series focuses on learning executable programs in arbitrary programming languages, from incomplete specifications. e.g. from examples of their input/output behaviour.
- The **3rd International Workshop on Human-Like Computing (HLC)**. HLC research aims to endow machines with human-like perceptual, reasoning and learning abilities which support collaboration and communication with human beings. The workshop aim is to bring together leading experts in AI and Cognitive Science to investigate areas of fruitful interaction in which human co-operative and communicative skills can be studied and modelled computationally.

IJCLR aims at bringing together researchers and practitioners working on various aspects of learning & reasoning, via presentation of cutting-edge research on topics of special interest to the participating conferences/workshops. In addition to each of the four events' individual programs, which will be held in parallel, IJCLR aims to promote collaboration and cross-fertilization between different approaches and methodologies to integrating learning & reasoning, via joint keynotes, panel discussions and poster sessions.
